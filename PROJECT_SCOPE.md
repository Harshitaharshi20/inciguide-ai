# Project Scope – InciGuide AI

## 1. Project Name
InciGuide AI

## 2. Project Goal
InciGuide AI helps users understand skincare product ingredients, 
check compatibility with their skin type, build safe skincare routines, 
and receive explainable AI guidance — without medical diagnosis or legal verification.

## 3. Target Users
- Skincare users confused by ingredient lists
- Users concerned about product compatibility and layering
- Users worried about duplicate or unsafe skincare products

## 4. Core Problems We Address
- Users do not understand ingredient names (INCI lists)
- Existing apps analyze products in isolation, not routines
- Users combine products that conflict with each other
- Duplicate skincare products create safety risks
- AI systems often give overconfident or fear-based advice

## 5. Core Features (MVP)
✔ Ingredient decoding and explanation  
✔ Skin-type-based compatibility analysis  
✔ Routine & layering guidance (AM / PM)  
✔ Explainable AI responses (“Why this matters”)  
✔ Confidence-aware outputs (High / Medium / Low)  
✔ Product Authenticity Confidence (advisory only)

## 6. Explicitly Out of Scope (Very Important)
✘ Medical diagnosis or treatment  
✘ Prescription or medical advice  
✘ Legal verification of product authenticity  
✘ Direct product selling or checkout  
✘ Brand-sponsored recommendations  

## 7. Responsible AI Principles
- Educational, not diagnostic
- Conservative language (“may help”, “commonly used”)
- Confidence & uncertainty are shown to users
- Human consultation suggested when confidence is low
- No fear-based or absolute claims

## 8. Success Criteria for MVP
- User can scan or input a product
- System explains ingredients clearly
- User understands whether the product fits their skin & routine
- System provides routine sequencing guidance
- System shows confidence and authenticity guidance clearly
